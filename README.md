At SkySentryAI, our mission is to revolutionize transportation management and safety during inclement weather. We are dedicated to empowering Department of Transportation agencies with advanced AI technology to make informed, proactive decisions. Our goal is to enhance road safety, reduce accidents, and minimize traffic disruptions during adverse weather conditions. By providing real-time weather insights and predictive analysis, we enable DOTs to determine staffing needs, deploy resources strategically, and mitigate weather-related incidents effectively. We are committed to creating a safer, more efficient, and resilient transportation network for the benefit of all communities we serve.

## Problem
Weather forecasts are not always accurate. Day in and day out there is unexpected poor weather around the world. The problem is that while there may be good weather in a town, there may be one section of a town that doesn't. We want to help Department of Transportation agencies know where and how many people to staff for a certain day. Furthermore, we want to help them redirect their staff to areas that would need the assistance more. For example an area that is foggy or rainy tends to need more assistance than where it is clear and sunny.
