# SkySentryAI
At SkySentryAI, our mission is to revolutionize transportation management and safety during inclement weather. We are dedicated to empowering Department of Transportation agencies with advanced AI technology to make informed, proactive decisions. Our goal is to enhance road safety, reduce accidents, and minimize traffic disruptions during adverse weather conditions. By providing real-time weather insights and predictive analysis, we enable DOTs to determine staffing needs, deploy resources strategically, and mitigate weather-related incidents effectively. We are committed to creating a safer, more efficient, and resilient transportation network for the benefit of all communities we serve.

## Problem
Weather forecasts are not always accurate. Day in and day out there is unexpected poor weather around the world. The problem is that while there may be good weather in a town, there may be one section of a town that doesn't. We want to help Department of Transportation agencies know where and how many people to staff for a certain day. Furthermore, we want to help them redirect their staff to areas that would need the assistance more. For example an area that is foggy or rainy tends to need more assistance than where it is clear and sunny.

## Alexnet Feature Map Integration

In the context of SkySentryAI, AlexNet's feature maps are instrumental in providing a nuanced understanding of weather patterns and conditions.

### What are Feature Maps?

Feature maps result from applying filters to input images at different convolutional layers of the neural network. In AlexNet, these maps represent high-level abstractions, capturing complex features like textures, shapes, and patterns within the input data.

### Understanding SkySentryAI's Weather Insights:

1. **Texture Recognition:** Feature maps from early layers recognize fundamental textures, aiding SkySentryAI in distinguishing between clear skies, clouds, and other weather-related textures.

2. **Pattern Analysis:** Intermediate feature maps capture intricate patterns in diverse weather conditions, enabling SkySentryAI to discern specific weather phenomena and anticipate changes in atmospheric patterns.

3. **Object Detection:** Later layers produce feature maps that excel in object detection. This is valuable for SkySentryAI, allowing it to identify and track objects like vehicles, road signs, and potential hazards in various weather scenarios.

4. **Contextual Understanding:** The hierarchical structure of feature maps enables SkySentryAI to build a contextual understanding of the environment. This means the AI can recognize how different elements within a scene relate to each other, providing a holistic view of the weather landscape.

### Impact on Decision-Making:

Leveraging these rich feature maps, SkySentryAI enhances its ability to make informed decisions. Whether predicting weather changes, identifying road conditions, or ensuring the safety of transportation routes, the feature maps generated by AlexNet significantly contribute to the app's ability to analyze and interpret complex visual data for weather-related insights.

Below is an example of one of the feature maps, that is being used by the alexnet model.

AlexNet is a groundbreaking convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012. Developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton, it marked a significant advance in image classification.

**Key Features:**

1. **Deep Structure:** AlexNet has eight layers, including five convolutional and three fully connected layers, challenging the belief that deep networks are hard to train.

2. **ReLU Activation:** It uses ReLU activation for faster training and to avoid the vanishing gradient problem.

3. **Normalization:** Incorporates local response normalization (LRN) in convolutional layers for better generalization.

4. **Dropout:** Employs dropout to prevent overfitting by deactivating some neurons during training.

5. **Data Augmentation:** Uses techniques like cropping and flipping during training to enhance dataset diversity.

6. **GPU Acceleration:** Utilizes GPU acceleration for faster training, making deep learning more practical for large datasets.

AlexNet's success revolutionized deep learning, influencing the design of modern CNNs used in image recognition, object detection, and more.
